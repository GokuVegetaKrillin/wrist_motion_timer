# wrist_motion_timer
wrist motion timer for fitbit versa 2.
this application tracks wrist motion and implements a sort of "timer" based on that. so the more you move your wrists, the faster the timer will go down. 100 points on the timer is approximately equivalent to 30 minutes of activity.
i likely will not be keeping this repository up-to-date, so if you have any improvements to suggest, the best option is probably forking the repository and implementing the changes there.
you need a fitbit developer app in order to install this on your fitbit. find one of the fitbit beginner tutorials online for instructions on how to install it.
if you want to install it on a device other than the versa 2, it is probably possible to do so. however, you will likely need to make a few modifications. in particular, in the file "package.json" you will likely need to modify "buildTargets".
